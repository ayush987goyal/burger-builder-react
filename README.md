# Burger Builder

[Hosted here](https://ayush987goyal.github.io/burger-builder-react/)

This is the follow-along project from Max's course on react.

I have migrated it to use new `react-hooks` and `easy-peasy` library for having a global redux state.

The `master` branch contains the `react-redux` and `redux-saga` based implementation.

The default `hook-easy` branch contains the hooks and `easy-peasy` implementation.
